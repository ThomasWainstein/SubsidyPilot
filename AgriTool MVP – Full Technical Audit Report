2. AgriToolScraper (Python) ‚Äì Core Scraper Audit
2.1 Entrypoints & Script Logic
Entrypoint: scraper_main.py

Target URL: Accepts as param/env for full automation (not hardcoded).

Pagination: Handles multiple pages (likely via parameter or site config).

Extraction:

Extracts fields from each subsidy detail page: name, amount, eligibility, deadline, URL, etc.

Supports text extraction, possible PDF/DOC download.

Language detection present for field mapping.

Robustness:

Error handling and retry logic included.

Logs failures and skips duplicates.

Batch/atomic operations to reduce data loss.

2.2 Configurability
Config via:

.env (Supabase keys/URLs)

CLI params for dry run, max pages, URLs.

Dry run:

Test mode prevents DB writes for debugging.

3. Supabase Integration
3.1 Client Module
File: supabase_client.py

Connects via:

SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY from env/secrets.

Table Write:

Inserts records into subsidies (one per scraped subsidy).

Duplicate detection: queries for existing unique field (e.g., URL/id), skips if present.

Robust upload with retry.

Logging:

Every run logs metadata, errors, stats to scraper_logs (timestamp, count, errors).

Centralizes run analytics and troubleshooting.

3.2 Security
Service key only for CI/automation (not exposed to users).

Env vars managed via GitHub Actions Secrets.

RLS (Row Level Security) on logs:

Service role can insert; authenticated users can read.

4. GitHub Actions / CI Pipeline
4.1 Workflow File (.github/workflows/scraper.yml)
Schedule:

Runs daily (cron: 6 AM UTC)

Manual trigger w/ custom params.

Environment:

Installs Python 3.9

Installs Chrome (headless, for Selenium)

Installs requirements from requirements.txt

Sets up secrets from repo.

Execution:

Runs scraper in configurable mode.

Dry run toggle, max pages, target URL as input.

Artifacts:

Uploads logs and results as GitHub Actions artifacts for auditing.

Failure Handling:

Marked as failed if any unhandled error.

Output logs always available for admin/dev review.

5. Database Schema & Deduplication
5.1 Table: subsidies
Fields:

id (serial)

name/title

url (unique)

amount

eligibility

deadline

region, tags, categories, etc.

Indexes:

On URL/ID for deduplication.

On tags/categories for filtering/search.

Schema:

Follows typical funding/subsidy model (flexible for future fields).

5.2 Table: scraper_logs
Fields:

id

run_timestamp

status (success/failure)

error_count, success_count

run parameters

full error messages/logs (JSON/text)

Indexes:

On timestamp for fast querying.

RLS:

Service role writes; users read.

6. Logging, Monitoring, and QA
6.1 Logging
In-code:

Every major event logs to stdout, and to scraper_logs table in Supabase.

In CI:

All logs captured by Actions and uploaded as artifacts.

User/Admin View:

Logs visible from Supabase SQL or API.

Artifact download from GitHub Actions.

6.2 Monitoring & Error Handling
Failures, timeouts, site errors, and skips are always logged.

Statistics per run (how many succeeded/failed/skipped) captured in logs.

Retries with backoff for transient network issues.

No silent data loss ‚Äì every record accounted for.

6.3 Test Coverage
Dry run mode allows full end-to-end validation without data writes.

Unit tests not found (suggest adding for helpers).

Manual test checklists present in project (see DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md).

7. Documentation & Developer Experience
7.1 Readme/Docs
README.md is present:

Explains project setup, secrets, running locally, CI pipeline, and troubleshooting.

.env.example:

Shows all required environment variables for setup.

Deployment, debugging, and QA checklists present (markdown files in root).

7.2 Code Quality
Python:

Code is modular (scraper, Supabase, logging split out).

Comments present, docstrings on main functions.

Typing hints are partial; recommend full coverage for maintainability.

TypeScript/React:

Linting/formatting configs (eslint, etc.) included.

Good separation of frontend logic from scraping.

Project hygiene:

.gitignore and lock files present.

No hardcoded secrets.

Requirements clean and reproducible.

8. Security
No service keys in repo (uses env/secrets only).

Supabase RLS enforced for all log writes.

GitHub Actions runs are permissioned, not public.

Chrome headless is sandboxed.

No evidence of XSS/CSRF exposure via scraper input.

9. Outstanding Issues & Recommendations
9.1 Known Gaps
No automatic alerting on failures (suggest Slack/email integration).

No test harness for unit or integration testing yet.

Timeout/anti-ban behavior for heavy scraping is minimal.

Data validation at insert time is basic ‚Äì add stricter schema checks.

CI pipeline is robust, but can be expanded to multi-source scraping (future work).

9.2 Next Steps
Add automated alerting for scraper failures.

Expand dry run mode to include sample output files.

Implement unit tests for field extraction and Supabase client.

Support multi-language field mapping and enrichment.

Continuous QA: Enable scheduled test runs with corrupted/broken/edge-case inputs.

More granular logging for failed rows/fields, not just runs.

Dashboard for log/analytics in frontend (optional, but valuable).

Consider Dockerizing the scraper for portability.

Is AgriTool MVP Scraper Pipeline Production-Ready?
Yes, for MVP launch.

All major pipelines are robust, scheduled, logged, and secure.

Missing only advanced monitoring, test automation, and alerting for a fully hardened production deployment.
