# Phase A: Core Stability & Robust Uploads - Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### 1. File Upload Testing
- [ ] Test .pdf files (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Test .docx files (various sizes)
- [ ] Test .xlsx files (both new and legacy .xls)
- [ ] Test .jpg/.png images
- [ ] Test files at 50MB limit (should succeed)
- [ ] Test files over 50MB (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test corrupt/fake files (renamed extensions)
- [ ] Test concurrent uploads
- [ ] Test upload interruption/network issues

### 2. User Experience Validation
- [ ] Verify no page redirects after upload
- [ ] Confirm user stays on Documents tab
- [ ] Check success toast notifications appear
- [ ] Verify document list updates in real-time
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify progress indicators work correctly
- [ ] Check error messages are specific and actionable

### 3. Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Test network failures during upload
- [ ] Test authentication errors
- [ ] Test file permission errors
- [ ] Test storage quota errors
- [ ] Verify error boundaries catch unexpected errors
- [ ] Check console logs for proper error tracking

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test upload speed with large files
- [ ] Verify UI remains responsive during uploads
- [ ] Test memory usage with multiple file uploads
- [ ] Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### 5. Security Validation
- [ ] Verify file type validation on frontend and backend
- [ ] Test file content validation (magic numbers)
- [ ] Check filename sanitization
- [ ] Verify user can only upload to their own farms
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts in form fields

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. Success Metrics to Track
- [ ] Upload success rate (target: >95%)
- [ ] Average upload time per file size
- [ ] User session duration on Documents tab
- [ ] Error rate by error type
- [ ] File type distribution

### 2. Error Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor edge function logs for upload errors
- [ ] Track client-side JavaScript errors
- [ ] Monitor Supabase storage errors
- [ ] Track authentication failures

### 3. User Feedback Indicators
- [ ] Reduced support tickets about uploads
- [ ] No reports of page redirects/reloads
- [ ] Positive feedback on upload experience
- [ ] Increased document upload volume

## Known Issues Resolved
✅ Excel files (.xls/.xlsx) now fully supported across all layers
✅ Page redirects after upload eliminated
✅ Improved error messages with specific details
✅ Real-time document list updates
✅ Consistent 50MB file size limit enforcement
✅ Enhanced upload progress indicators

## Rollback Plan
If critical issues are discovered:
1. Revert to previous DocumentUploadForm.tsx
2. Restore original useDocumentUpload hook
3. Check edge function deployment status
4. Verify Supabase bucket configurations
5. Monitor for 15 minutes post-rollback

## Next Phase Preparation
Phase B (Data Enrichment) dependencies:
- [ ] Upload system stable with >95% success rate
- [ ] Error logging capturing all edge cases
- [ ] User feedback positive on upload experience
- [ ] No critical bugs reported for 48 hours
