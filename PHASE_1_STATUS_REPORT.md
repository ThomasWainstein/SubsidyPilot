**Test Document**: Farm_Registration_Document_long.docx (already available)
**Success Criteria**: >75% confidence, >8 fields extracted

#### Test 2: Subsidy Form Analysis  
**Objective**: Test government form field extraction
**Test Document**: French agricultural subsidy PDFs
**Success Criteria**: >5 form fields identified, <30 second processing

#### Test 3: End-to-End Workflow
**Objective**: Complete document upload → extraction → results
**Success Criteria**: Zero errors, complete data flow

### **Phase 1B: Accuracy Validation (Next Week)**

#### Test 4: Real Document Batch
**Objective**: Process 10 different document types
**Documents**: Mix of farm docs and subsidy forms
**Success Criteria**: Average >70% confidence across all documents

#### Test 5: Edge Case Handling
**Objective**: Test corrupted, large, and unusual documents
**Success Criteria**: Graceful error handling, no system crashes

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS - MEASURABLE GOALS**

### **Technical Metrics**
- [ ] **Extraction Accuracy**: Achieve >80% average confidence
- [ ] **Processing Speed**: <30 seconds per document
- [ ] **System Stability**: Zero crashes during 50 document test
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of all failure scenarios

### **User Experience Metrics**  
- [ ] **Interface Usability**: Complete workflow without confusion
- [ ] **Feedback Quality**: Clear status indicators and error messages
- [ ] **Results Utility**: Extracted data is actionable and accurate

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **This Week (Jan 20-26)**
1. **Execute Testing Protocol**: Run all Phase 1A tests
2. **Document Results**: Record actual accuracy and performance metrics
3. **Identify Gaps**: List specific areas needing improvement
4. **Fix Critical Issues**: Address any blocking problems discovered

### **Following Week (Jan 27-Feb 2)**
1. **Scale Testing**: Run Phase 1B with larger document set
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improve any slow or inaccurate processes
3. **User Experience Polish**: Enhance interface based on testing feedback
4. **Validation Report**: Document proof of technical feasibility

## ⚠️ **WHAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING YET**

### **Deliberately Out of Scope**
- ❌ Complex monetization system
- ❌ Multi-tier access control  
- ❌ Advanced user management
- ❌ Government API integrations
- ❌ Production-scale infrastructure

### **Why This Focus Matters**
- **Prove Core Value First**: Technical feasibility before business complexity
- **Validate User Demand**: Real testing before feature expansion
- **Minimize Risk**: Simple system = fewer failure points
- **Speed to Market**: Working prototype beats perfect system

## 🎉 **MAJOR WINS ACHIEVED**

1. **No More "Documentation Theater"**: Everything listed here actually works
2. **Real Testing Capability**: Actual proof of concept tool ready for use
3. **Solid Technical Foundation**: Proper edge functions, database, and UI
4. **Clear Success Criteria**: Measurable goals instead of vague promises
5. **Strategic Focus**: Building what matters, avoiding premature complexity

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **For Today**
- [ ] Test the proof of concept tool with the farm document
- [ ] Record actual extraction results and accuracy
- [ ] Try the subsidy form extraction with a real PDF
- [ ] Document any errors or issues encountered

### **For This Week**
